# poisonous_mushroom_classification
## Description
This project is aimed at identifing poisonous mushrooms from edible ones with the help of computer vision. This is done with the help of python,keras,tensorflow and many other libraries. Approaches present in this project to tackle the given problem include use of transfer learning and custom convolutional neural networks. This project has step by step information on the approaches as well is structure in such a way that other classification problems can also be done with similar approach without any major changes. All work done in this project is with the help of standard version of google collab.

## Visuals

- Visuals are very important! You might want to include screenshots of your code in operation. GIFS are also great!
- Just use the "![ ]()" to input images.

## Installation 

- Describe how your software / development is installed. Sometimes it's easy as something like:

```bash
sudo apt-get install my-cool-thing
```

- often it involves a bit of  downloading sources and building:

```bash
git clone my-cool-repo.git
cd /my-cool-repo
cd /build
make
```

- You should list out steps as unambiguously as humanly possible!!
- Often people don't read the actual install instructions, but they just copy and paste what is in the black boxes. __Keep this in mind!__

## Usage

- Describe how the program / project is going to be used once it is installed. 
- If it is a command line app, you'll want to give CLI examples:

```bash
cool-project -arg1 -arg2
```

- then maybe show a screenshot of  the results :smile:

## Support

- tell users how they can get a hold of you
